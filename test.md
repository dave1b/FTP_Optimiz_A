The exercise asks you to transform a given linear programming (LP) problem into four different forms:

1. **Maximizing problem in canonical form**
2. **Minimizing problem in canonical form**
3. **Minimizing problem in standard form**
4. **Maximizing problem in inequality form**

Let's break down each step and form, providing the path to the solution. But first, let’s rewrite the LP in its current form:

### Given LP in General Form:
\[
\text{minimize } x_1 - 2x_2 - 3x_3
\]  
Subject to:
\[
\begin{aligned}
x_1 + 2x_2 + 4x_3 &\geq 12 \\
x_1 - x_2 + x_3 &= 2 \\
x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 &\leq 14 \\
x_1 &\geq 0 \\
x_2 &\text{ is free (can take any value)} \\
x_3 &\leq 0
\end{aligned}
\]

Now, let’s understand the different forms:

---

### 1. **Maximizing Problem in Canonical Form**

Canonical form for maximization looks like:
- Maximize a linear objective function subject to inequality constraints (all \(\leq\)) and non-negative variables.

#### Steps to convert:
- **Convert minimization to maximization**: To convert minimization to maximization, multiply the objective function by \(-1\).
  \[
  \text{maximize } -x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3
  \]

- **Inequality direction**: Ensure all inequality constraints are in \(\leq\) form.
    - \( x_1 + 2x_2 + 4x_3 \geq 12 \) becomes \( -x_1 - 2x_2 - 4x_3 \leq -12 \).
    - The equality constraint \( x_1 - x_2 + x_3 = 2 \) can be left as is (although we may have to convert it into two inequalities later if required).

- **Variables**: Ensure all variables are non-negative.
    - \(x_1 \geq 0\) is already non-negative.
    - \(x_3 \leq 0\): We can define a new variable \(x_3' = -x_3\) such that \(x_3' \geq 0\). Substitute \(x_3' = -x_3\) in the constraints and objective function.
    - \(x_2\) is free: Split \(x_2\) into two non-negative variables \(x_2 = x_2^+ - x_2^-\), where \(x_2^+, x_2^- \geq 0\).

Now you can write the maximization problem in canonical form with these changes.

### 2. **Minimizing Problem in Canonical Form**

Canonical form for minimization requires the objective to be a minimization, with all inequality constraints in \(\geq\) form and variables non-negative.

#### Steps:
- The minimization objective remains the same: 
  \[
  \text{minimize } x_1 - 2x_2 - 3x_3
  \]

- **Inequality constraints** should be in \(\geq\) form.
    - \( x_1 + 2x_2 + 4x_3 \geq 12 \) is already in the correct form.
    - The equality constraint remains the same.
    - \( x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 \leq 14 \) becomes \( -(x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3) \geq -14 \).

- **Variables**: Handle \(x_2\) (free) and \(x_3\) (non-positive) as before.
    - \(x_2 = x_2^+ - x_2^-\), and \(x_3' = -x_3\) with \(x_3' \geq 0\).

---

### 3. **Minimizing Problem in Standard Form**

In **standard form**, the problem must be a minimization problem with equality constraints only and all variables non-negative.

#### Steps to convert:
- **Objective function** remains the same: 
  \[
  \text{minimize } x_1 - 2x_2 - 3x_3
  \]

- **Convert inequalities to equalities** by introducing slack or surplus variables:
    - \(x_1 + 2x_2 + 4x_3 \geq 12\) becomes \(x_1 + 2x_2 + 4x_3 - s_1 = 12\), where \(s_1 \geq 0\).
    - \(x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 \leq 14\) becomes \(x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 + s_2 = 14\), where \(s_2 \geq 0\).

- **Variables**: 
    - Handle \(x_2\) and \(x_3\) as before.

This gives you a standard form LP.

---

### 4. **Maximizing Problem in Inequality Form**

In this form, we want the problem to be a maximization problem with inequality constraints only (no equalities).

#### Steps to convert:
- **Convert to maximization** as done in the first step.

- **Convert equality constraints into inequalities**:
    - Split \(x_1 - x_2 + x_3 = 2\) into two inequalities:
      \[
      x_1 - x_2 + x_3 \geq 2 \quad \text{and} \quad x_1 - x_2 + x_3 \leq 2
      \]

- **Ensure all variables are non-negative** using the same methods as before for \(x_2\) and \(x_3\).

Now you have the LP in inequality form with only inequalities and no equalities.

---

### Explanation of Forms:
1. **Canonical Form**: A form where the problem is either a maximization or minimization with all inequality constraints (\(\leq\) for maximization and \(\geq\) for minimization) and all variables non-negative.
   
2. **Standard Form**: A minimization (or maximization) problem with all constraints as equalities and non-negative variables.

3. **Inequality Form**: A maximization (or minimization) problem where all constraints are inequalities, and no equalities are allowed.

---

### Path to the Solution:
1. First, convert the objective to maximization or minimization as needed.
2. Ensure that constraints are in the appropriate form (either \(\leq\), \(\geq\), or equalities).
3. Handle free and non-positive variables by introducing new non-negative variables.
4. Finally, introduce slack or surplus variables as needed to convert inequalities into equalities for the standard form.

By following this step-by-step procedure, you'll have the transformed LP in the required forms.
